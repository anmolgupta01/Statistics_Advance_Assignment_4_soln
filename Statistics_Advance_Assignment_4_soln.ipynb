    "A t-test and a z-test are both statistical hypothesis tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. However, they are used in slightly different situations due to differences in assumptions about the population and sample size. Here are the key differences and example scenarios for each test:\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-Test:\n",
    "\n",
    "Population Standard Deviation Known: A z-test is used when you know the population standard deviation (σ) and are testing a sample mean (x̄) against a known population mean (μ).\n",
    "Sample Size: Z-tests are typically used when the sample size is large (usually n > 30), as they rely on the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means becomes approximately normal regardless of the population distribution when the sample size is sufficiently large.\n",
    "Example Scenario: Imagine you are a quality control manager in a factory that produces light bulbs. You know from historical data that the population standard deviation of the bulb lifetimes is σ = 100 hours. You want to test whether a new manufacturing process has improved bulb lifetimes, and you take a sample of 50 bulbs, calculate their mean lifetime (x̄), and want to determine if it is significantly different from the old mean lifetime (μ = 800 hours). You would use a z-test in this case.\n",

    "\n",
    "Population Standard Deviation Unknown: A t-test is used when you do not know the population standard deviation (σ) and are testing a sample mean (x̄) against a hypothesized population mean (μ).\n",
    "Sample Size: T-tests are typically used when the sample size is small (usually n < 30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "Example Scenario: Let's say you are a researcher studying the heights of a new species of plants. You collect a sample of 20 plants, measure their heights, and want to test if the average height of these plants is different from a standard height of 30 cm (μ = 30 cm). Since you don't know the population standard deviation for this new species, you would use a t-test."

However, due to random chance or sampling error, your statistical test suggests a significant improvement in patients' conditions when, in fact, the drug has no real effect. This is a Type I error.
